# Frontend Web Development Misclues

I'm creating this repository to document and showcase my journey learning and practicing frontend web development. As a backend Java Spring Boot developer, I realize that many software engineering positions either require or appreciate frontend knowledge.

This repository includes everything from my first simple HTML projects (like `<h1>Hello World</h1>`) to complete web applications using:

- Native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Bootstrap for responsive, mobile-first design
- React with Tailwind CSS

## ðŸ“Œ Earlier Projects

ðŸ‘‰ [PersonalPage - First CSS Training Project](https://github.com/ehab-elshimi-developer/PersonalPage): My first static landing page built with basic HTML and CSS.

ðŸ‘‰ [CaraShop - Bootstrap Landing Page](https://github.com/ehab-elshimi-developer/CaraShop): A responsive Bootstrap-based landing page with a modern design and clean layout, showcasing progress in structuring and styling pages for different devices.

All projects are organized and uploaded here to demonstrate my understanding of building frontend applications and connecting them with backend services. This complements my core backend expertise, and strengthens my profile as a well-rounded software engineer.

_Stay tuned as I continue to grow this repository!_
