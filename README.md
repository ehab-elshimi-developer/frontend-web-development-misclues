# 🌐 Frontend Web Development Misclues

🎯 This repository documents my **archived frontend learning journey**.  
Although I specialize in **Backend Development with Java & Spring Boot**, I strongly believe in having a working knowledge of frontend technologies to better collaborate in full-stack environments and understand UI/UX needs.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

- These are **not production-level apps** — they are small-scale learning exercises and practical reviews.
- They reflect the **concepts I studied before my military service**, recently reviewed and reimplemented for reinforcement.
- This repo acts as a **central archive** of all my frontend practice projects for future reference, documentation, and reflection.

## 🛠️ Frontend Skills Reviewed

During this review phase, I refreshed my knowledge of:

- ✅ **HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5**
- ✅ **JavaScript** (DOM manipulation, Events, UI logic)
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- ✅ **React.js** (Components, State, Props, Hooks)
- ✅ **Next.js** (Pages, Routing, SSR fundamentals)

> I revisited both the basics and key intermediate features across these technologies.
